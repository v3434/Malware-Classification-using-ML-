# Malware-Classification-using-ML
## Project Overview: 
This project investigates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting cyber attacks. By analyzing network data, we aim to identify patterns and correlations that differentiate normal network traffic from malicious activity. This approach can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of cyber attack detection, ultimately enhancing the security of digital networks and systems.

## Business Understanding
Cybersecurity is a critical concern in today's digital world. Traditional methods of detecting cyber attacks are often resource-intensive and struggle to keep pace with evolving threats. Machine learning offers a promising solution, leveraging algorithms to automatically learn and identify malicious patterns within network data. This project aims to develop a robust and efficient system for cyber attack detection using machine learning techniques.

## Data Understanding
The data for this project originates from the University of New South Wales (Australia) and consists of network packets captured in their Cyber Range Lab. This rich dataset includes records of various cyber attacks, categorized into nine distinct types. Exploring these attack categories is crucial for understanding the diverse threats organizations face and for building a comprehensive detection system.

The data also includes several network traffic-related variables. We identified specific features that exhibit positive correlations with cyber attacks, such as source-to-destination time-to-live values, connection state details, and traffic rates. Conversely, some features demonstrate a negative correlation with attacks, potentially indicating normal network behavior. These insights provide valuable guidance in selecting and engineering features for our machine learning models.

## Modeling and Evaluation
We employed several machine learning classifiers for cyber attack detection, including XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. To optimize model performance, we implemented ensemble learning techniques and conducted hyperparameter tuning. After rigorous evaluation, the XGBoost classifier emerged as the most effective model, demonstrating superior performance in identifying cyber attacks within the network data.
